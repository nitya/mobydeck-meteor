## Introduction

MobyDeck is a concept application being developed as an interactive companion to the __Moebius Noodles__ book on "Adventurous math for the playground crowd".

The project aims to support the organic creation, sharing and usage of "activity" ideas by parents, educators and children themselves. In particular, by encouraging children to come up with their own games or examples of a concept, we not only reinforce their understanding of it -- but also provide *other* children with new examples that are potentially worded or contexutalized to environments they can understand.

## Collaborators

This project is a joint collaboration between Dr. Maria Droujkova (co-founder of Moebius Noodles) and myself. The initial goal is to create and explore an application prototype for early childhood learning of mathematics concepts. A long-term goal is to make this into a platform for different subjects that can be organically grown and supported by an engaged community of participants.

## Licensing

This project is currently intended to be an open-source and non-commerical effort targeted at engaging more parents, educators and students in conversations and activities around math and science education. However, we use software (see Acknowledgments below) that provide _different_ licensing terms. Please respect those requirements when using or extending this work.

### Bootstraptor Styling
The project extensively uses themes and templates created by [Bootstraptor] (http://www.bootstraptor.com) and distributed as part of its _paid_ "Pro" KIT for Bootstrap 3.0.

Please refer to the accompanying README.Bootstraptor.txt and License.BOOTSTRAPTOR.txt for more information on usage constraints. The templates and themes used in this project may NOT be extracted or reused in any form in any other original or derivative work without purchase of the relevant Bootstraptor license.

### Isotope Layout
The project also leverages Isotope (currently in conjunction with a Bootstraptor template). The licensing terms for Isotope are available [here](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/license.html#content) and require the purchase of a commercial license if the code is used within a 'paid' project.  The project provides free licensing terms for open-source and personal projects.
